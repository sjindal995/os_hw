<h1>Homework-1:</h1>
<h2> Submission Deadline: 27th January, 3PM </h2>
<h1>Part-1: Shell</h1>

<p>This assignment will make you more familiar with the Unix system call
interface and the shell by implementing several features in a small shell.

</p><p>Download the <a href="http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/%7Ekedia/os/sh.c">shell</a>, and look it
over. The shell contains two main parts: parsing shell commands and
implementing them. The parser recognizes only simple shell commands such as the
following:

</p><pre>ls &gt; y
cat &lt; y | sort | uniq | wc &gt; y1
cat y1
rm y1
ls |  sort | uniq | wc
rm y
</pre>
Cut and paste these commands into a file <tt>t.sh</tt>

<p>To compile <tt>sh.c</tt>, you need a C compiler, such as gcc.  

</p><p>Assuming you have gcc, you can compile the skeleton shell as follows:
</p><pre>$ gcc sh.c
</pre>
which produce an <tt>a.out</tt> file, which you can run:
<pre>$ ./a.out &lt; t.sh
or,
$ ./a.out will give you an interactive shell
</pre>
This execution will print error messages because you have not implemented several features. In
the rest of this assignment you will implement those features.

<h2>1.A. Executing simple commands</h2>

<p>Implement simple commands, such as:
</p><pre>$ ls
</pre>

<p> <b>Coding-1: </b>The parser already builds an <tt>execcmd</tt> for you, so the only code you
have to write is for the ' ' case in <tt>runcmd</tt>. You might find it useful
to look at the manual page for exec; type "man 3 exec", and read about
<tt>execv</tt>.  Print an error message when exec fails.

</p><p>To test your program, compile and run the resulting a.out:
</p><pre>$./a.out
</pre>

This prints a prompt and waits for input.  <tt>sh.c</tt> prints as prompt
<tt>OS$</tt> so that you don't get confused with your computer's shell.

Now type to your shell:
<pre>OS$ ls
</pre>

<p>Your shell should print an error message (unless there is a program named
<tt>ls</tt> in your working directory).  Now type to your shell:

</p><pre>OS$ /bin/ls
</pre>

<p>This should execute the program <tt>/bin/ls</tt>, which should print out the
file names in your working directory. You can stop the shell by tying
ctrl-d or Ctrl-c, which should put you back in your computer's shell.

</p><p><b>Coding-2: </b>Change the shell to always try <tt>/bin</tt>, if the program
doesn't exist in the current working directory, so that below you don't have to
type "/bin" for each program.</p>

<p>Optional: If you are ambitious you can implement support for a <tt>PATH</tt> variable.</p>

<h2>1.B. I/O redirection</h2>

<p> <b>Coding-3: </b>Implement I/O redirection commands so that you can run:
</p><pre>echo "This is OS course" &gt; x.txt
cat &lt; x.txt
</pre>

<p>The parser already recognizes "&gt;" and "&lt;", and builds a <tt>redircmd</tt> for
you, so your job is just filling out the missing code in <tt>runcmd</tt> for
those symbols. You might find the man pages for open and close useful

</p><p>Make sure you print an error message if one of the system calls you are using fails.

</p><p>Make sure your implementation runs correctly with the above test input.  A
common error is to forget to specify the permission with which the file must be
created (i.e., the 3rd argument to open).

</p><h2>1.C. Implement pipes</h2>

<p><b>Coding-4: </b>Implement pipes so that you can run command pipelines such as:
</p><pre>$ ls | sort | uniq | wc
</pre>

<p>The parser already recognizes "|", and builds a <tt>pipecmd</tt> for you, so
the only code you must write is for the '|' case in <tt>runcmd</tt>.  You might
find the man pages for pipe, fork, close, and dup useful.

</p><p>Test that you can run the above pipeline. The <tt>sort</tt> program may be in
the directory <tt>/usr/bin/</tt> and in that case you can type the absolute
pathname <tt>/usr/bin/sort</tt> to run sort.  (In your computer's shell you can
type <tt>which sort</tt> to find out which directory in the shell's search path
has an executable named "sort".)

</p><p>Now you should be able the following command correctly:
</p><pre>$ a.out &lt; t.sh
</pre>

<p>Make sure you use the right absolute pathnames for the programs.

</p><h2> Submission</h2>
<p>Submission is to be done on the moodle at the appropriate link.
Just upload your sh.c file, no other file needs to be uploaded with this.</p>
<p>
Make sure that your code compiles and works without any special switch being used with gcc.
e.g. <tt>gcc sh.c </tt>should not give any error.

</p>

<h2> Note</h2>

<p>You completed the design of a basic Unix shell. Supporting any of the below features will require
changes to be done in the parser as well as the <tt>runcmd</tt> function.
We leave this to the interest of students for further exploration.
</p><ul>
<li> Implement lists of commands, separated by ";"
</li><li> Implement sub shells by implementing "(" and ")"
</li><li> Implement running commands in the background by supporting "&amp;" and "wait"
</li></ul>
<h1>Part-2: Syscall</h1>


<p>
This homework requires downloading the xv6 learning OS.
</p><pre>$ <kbd> wget www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~kedia/os/xv6.tar.gz</kbd>
$ <kbd> tar -zxvf xv6.tar.gz</kbd>
$ <kbd> cd xv6</kbd>
</pre>
<p></p>
<h4>Booting xv6:</h4>
<p>
Similar to our JOS, you need to type the below commands to boot xv6:
</p><pre>$ <kbd> make</kbd>
$ <kbd> make qemu</kbd>
</pre>
<p></p>

<h2><b> Coding-1</b>: System call tracing</h2>

Your first task is to modify the xv6 kernel to print out a line for
each system call invocation. It is enough to print the name of the
system call and the return value; you don't need to print the system
call arguments.

<p>
When you're done, you should see output like this when booting
xv6:

</p><pre>...
fork -&gt; 2
exec -&gt; 0
open -&gt; 3
close -&gt; 0
$write -&gt; 1
 write -&gt; 1
</pre>

<p>
That's init forking and execing sh, sh making sure only two file
descriptors are open, and sh writing the $ prompt.

</p><p>
<b>Hint:</b> modify the syscall() function in syscall.c.

</p><h2><b>Coding-2</b>: Date system call</h2>

Your second task is to add a new system call to xv6. The main point of
the exercise is for you to see some of the different pieces of the
system call machinery.

Your new system call will get the current time and return it to the user
program. You may want to use the helper function, <tt>cmostime()</tt>
(defined in <tt>lapic.c</tt>), to read the real time clock. <tt>date.h</tt>
contains the definition of the <tt>struct rtcdate</tt> struct, which you will
provide as an argument to <tt>cmostime()</tt> as a pointer.

<p>
You should create a user-level program that calls your new date system
call; here's some source you should put in <tt>date.c</tt>:

</p><pre>#include "types.h"
#include "user.h"
#include "date.h"

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  struct rtcdate r;

  if (date(&amp;r)) {
    printf(2, "date failed\n");
    exit();
  }

  // your code to print the time in any format you like...
  /* example output format should be like this:
     Year: 2016
	 Month: 1 or January
	 Date: 26
	 Hour: 15
	 Minute: 12
	 Second: 11

  */


  exit();
}
</pre>

<p>
In order to make your new <tt>date</tt> program available to run from
the xv6 shell, add <tt>_date</tt> to the <tt>UPROGS</tt> definition
in <tt>Makefile</tt>.

</p><p>
Your strategy for making a date system call should be to clone all of
the pieces of code that are specific to some existing system call, for
example the "uptime" system call. You should grep for uptime in all
the source files, using <tt>grep -n uptime *.[chS]</tt>.

</p><p>
When you're done, typing <tt>date</tt> to an xv6 shell prompt
should print the current time.

</p><h2><b>Coding-3</b>: dup2() system call.</h2>
<p>
Read Linux man pages for description on dup2 system call.
xv6 doesn't implement the dup2 system call by default and you are required to implement dup2 as a part
of this assignment.
</p>
<p>
The function prototype for dup2 is as below:</p>
<p>
      <tt>int dup2(int oldfd, int newfd);</tt>
</p>
<p>
The difference from the native dup call is that instead of allocating the first available file descriptor,
the user can specify through newfd which exact file descriptor should be used.
</p>
<p>

<b>Hint:</b> Look into the sys_dup function in the file syscall.c

</p>
<p>
Similar to date syscall, you can check the functioning of dup2 system call
by creating your own user program and making it available to the xv6 shell.

</p>
